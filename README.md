This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). This challenge helped me improve my basic HTML and CSS layout skills by creating a responsive QR code component card.

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of:

```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
-Centering elements vertically and horizontally using Flexbox.

-Styling components with consistent spacing, border-radius, and color themes.

-Using media queries to ensure responsiveness on mobile devices.


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

Explore more semantic HTML elements for accessibility.

Improve responsive layout techniques using CSS Grid.

Learn to structure my CSS better for larger projects.
